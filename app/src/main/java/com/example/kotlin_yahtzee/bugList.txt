Where I'm up to - Need to start converting the business logic from Java to Kotlin taking into account the viewmodel. The UI is mostly done until i write more functionality
Maybe need to add a counter for the rerolls. Currently it's not obvious how many you have


Randomly crashes when using 2 players.

The rolls left is inconsistent, sometimes you can only choose category

3 and 4 of a kind keeps being 0


**** Changed the game creation on the UI to always input AI players as 0 - This needs to be changed once AI is implemented


DONE - Need to make it so you can't pick a category that you've already picked

DONE - Calculate dice images, needs a default return, so I've just used Dice one for now - added an else that throws an error

DONE - AIPlayer entry crashes app if it's empty - need to stop button if there's no value

DONE - Scorecard display could be more efficient - some sort of loop

DONE - default category selected is 0 for ones, this is not good - Now -1, this doesn't automatically select one, but is still not good - Now won't do anything is invalid category selected
