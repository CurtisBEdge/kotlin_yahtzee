Where I'm up to - Need to start implementing the AI players now. just writing the logic for choosing which dice to keep





**** Changed the game creation on the UI to always input AI players as 0 - This needs to be changed once AI is implemented
DONE - AI calculated odds for categories that had already be used. Now this is calculated to 0.

DONE - Randomly crashes when using 2 players.

DONE - The rolls left is inconsistent, sometimes you can only choose category - does it every other turn, unless you keep all, then it resets

DONE 3 and 4 of a kind keeps being 0

DONE - Need to make it so you can't pick a category that you've already picked

DONE - Calculate dice images, needs a default return, so I've just used Dice one for now - added an else that throws an error

DONE - AIPlayer entry crashes app if it's empty - need to stop button if there's no value

DONE - Scorecard display could be more efficient - some sort of loop

DONE - default category selected is 0 for ones, this is not good - Now -1, this doesn't automatically select one, but is still not good - Now won't do anything is invalid category selected
